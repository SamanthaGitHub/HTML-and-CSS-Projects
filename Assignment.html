<p>An opinion on why cats are the best:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.insider.com/studies-about-why-cats-make-good-pets-2019-12">
Researchers from Oregon State University looked at the preferences of cats and their findings suggest 
cats actually enjoy interacting with humans more than food.

The study, published in the journal "Behavioural Processes," tested both pets and shelter cats 
(around 55 in total) to see if they would prefer to interact with food, toys, scent, or social 
interaction with humans like petting or playing.

Social interaction was the activity most preferred by cats across both groups, according to the 
researchers, followed by food.
